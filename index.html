<p>I am an army brat who traveled all across the globe from Germany to Seattle, Washington. I was born in Camden, NJ but it serves as a geographical location where my family resides and an understanding as to why I am a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan. My family moved to Columbus, Ohio eventually and that is where I consider home. At 10 years old I fell in love with technology. I would take apart most of my gaming systems in attempt to mod them and understand how they worked. As well as taking my systems apart I became an avid collector and enjoyed talking about everything gaming. I started a podcast with one of my close friends. We post the video version on Youtube and an audio version on all major platforms. I followed that passion into my twenties and worked as a repair technician for Lucent technologies. I then moved into a role with Verizon to further understand how technology works and how devices spoke to one another. My love for understanding technology is what lead me to the coding bootcamp WeCanCodeIt.</p>
